You can have many nodes on the same machine.\r\nEach node communicates with other node through a couple (host, port).\r\nA node can have one or many servers.\r\n* servers: A server provides one or more services and listen client connections through a couple (host, port).\r\nA server has a unique name and can be one of types: restify, express, socket.io, message bus...\r\n* services: A service offer one feature to clients. A service can be one of: static assets providers, middleware provider, model RESTfull access...\r\n* applications: An application contains some services and is provided through nodes and servers.\r\nAn application can have one service on one server on one node.\r\nOr many services on many servers on many nodes.\r\n* modules: functional features for applications (a set of preconfigured UI for example).\r\n* plugins: technical fearures for applications (a rendering provider for example).\r\n* security: defines authentication and authorization rules.\r\n\r\nThe rendering engines are plugins and rendering classes are stateless: state is stored in a Redux store.\r\nSee [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) for flow concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Devapt is a glue between many usefull projects\r\nThanks for all projects leaders and contributers.\r\n\r\nThe given list is an extract of all used or inspired projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain dependancies:\r\n\r\nNodeJS: https://nodejs.org\r\n\r\nServers and datas access:\r\n* Express: http://expressjs.com/\r\n* Restify: http://restify.com/\r\n* Epilogue: https://github.com/dchester/epilogue\r\n* Sequelize: http://sequelizejs.com\r\n* Socket.io: http://socket.io/\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n* Passport: http://passportjs.org\r\n* Node ACL: https://github.com/OptimalBits/node_acl\r\n\r\nFoundations\r\n* SimpleBus: https://github.com/ajlopez/SimpleBus\r\n* jQuery: https://jquery.com\r\n* Immutable: https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/\r\n* Redux: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html\r\n* Moment: http://momentjs.com/\r\n* Vantage: https://github.com/dthree/vantage\r\n* Bunyan: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan\r\n* Winston: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\r\n* Circuit breaker: https://www.npmjs.com/package/circuit-breaker or https://github.com/yammer/circuit-breaker-js\r\n\r\nRendering:\r\n* Foundation by ZURB: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html\r\n* Mustache: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js\r\n* React: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDev and build dependancies: (coming soon.)\r\n* Babel:\r\n* Chai:\r\n* Gulp\r\n* Mocha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the file called INSTALL.md.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTo subscribe to news or report a bug or contribute to the project, use the project website at https://github.com/lucbories/DevApt.\r\n",
