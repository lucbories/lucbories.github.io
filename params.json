  "body": "# Devapt\r\n\r\nWith DEVAPT you can easily develop powerfull application.\r\nBuilt-in features cover many important subjects as: authentication, restfull, http server, distributed services, logs, metrics...\r\nMain characteristics of DEVAPT architecture is dynamic behaviors, reactive programming, object oriented ES6 javascript, gulp build chain\r\nAll of this on NodeJS.\r\n\r\nA usefull application is DEVTOOLS which actualy display settings, logs, buses messages, metrics and topology.\r\n[DEVTOOLS project](https://github.com/lucbories/devapt-devtools/)\r\n\r\nIn a near futur, DEVTOOLS will act as a configurable application builder for DEVAPT applications.\r\n\r\ndevapt and devapt-* github repositories have the same structure: a master branch with the last tagged tree, a develop branch with latest comited updates and tags.\r\n\r\nVersionning use standard method: M.m.p with M is a major change, m a minor change, p a patch.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 0.9.5 (do not use in production environment)\r\n\r\nNPM module isn't available yet, please download devapt source insteed and make a NPM link (npm -l).\r\n\r\nModule would be available before version 1.0.0 final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## WHAT IS IT?\r\n\r\nThe Developpers Application Toolkit is a usefull package for developers:\r\ncreate quickly and securely a complex distributed set of applications or a simple alone application into one or more nodejs.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on Javascript (ECMAscript 6 transpiled in ES5) and nodejs.\r\nDevapt contains a server runtime and a set of client features.\r\nDevapt help you to write less code and to use easily more features.\r\n\r\nThe principle is simple: you write some configuration files for distributed nodes, models, views and menus and the you start the application.\r\nThe framework will automatically generates the server and manages common features (logges, traces, metrics, restful, security...).\r\nSimply launch index.html and your application is up a rich user interface and many features.\r\n\r\nSee [FEATURES](docs/FEATURES.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\n\r\nSee [GETTING_STARTED](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)\r\n\r\nDocumentation: [API](https://lucbories.github.io/api/index.html)\r\n\r\nDevapt library offers a \"runtime\" instance which delivers this features:\r\n* browser or server rendering (Render instance)\r\n* rendering base class for custom widgets or views (Component class)\r\n* Redux store on client side\r\n* distributed servers\r\n* master configuration settings (distributed on each nodes)\r\n* loggers engines and traces configuration (for instances, classes, modules)\r\n* datas abstraction\r\n* reactive programming (thanks BaconJS)\r\n* documentation (wotrk in progress)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## LICENCE\r\n\r\nCopyright Luc BORIES 2015-2016\r\n\r\nApache Version 2 license.\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## ROADMAP\r\n0.9.0   initial release (not ready for production)\r\n1.0.0   first stable release\r\n1.1.0   add features and tests\r\n\r\nSee [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## BUGS\r\n\r\nSee [BUGS](https://github.com/lucbories/Devapt/issues)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n\r\nWith Devapt you define \r\n* A topology, simple (one application, one server, one service) or complex (many services distributed for many applications on many distributed servers).\r\n* Some resources (models, views, menubars, menus)\r\n* Security rules\r\n\r\nA topology contains:\r\n* nodes: A node is a nodejs process with an unique name. You can have many nodes on the same machine.\r\nEach node communicates with other node through messaging buses (messages, metrics, logs).\r\n\r\n![Messaging](docs/features/Buses.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nA node can have one or many servers.\r\n* servers: A server provides one or more services and listen client connections through a couple (host, port).\r\n\r\nA server has a unique name and can be one of types: restify, express, socket.io (coming soon)...\r\n* services: A service offers one feature to clients. A service can be one of: static assets providers, generic middleware provider, RESTfull provider, resources provider...\r\n* applications: An application contains some services and is provided through nodes and servers.\r\nAn application can have one service on one server on one node.\r\nOr many services on many servers on many nodes.\r\n\r\nAn application contains:\r\n* modules: functional features for applications (a set of preconfigured UI for example).\r\n* plugins: technical fearures for applications (a rendering provider for example).\r\n* security: defines authentication and authorization rules.\r\n\r\n![Distributed](docs/features/Host.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rendering engines are plugins and rendering classes are stateless: state is stored in a Redux store.\r\nSee [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) for flow concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Devapt is a glue between many powerfull projects\r\nThanks for all projects leaders and contributers.\r\n\r\nThe given list is an extract of all used or inspired projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain dependancies:\r\n\r\nNodeJS: https://nodejs.org\r\n\r\nServers and datas access:\r\n* Express: http://expressjs.com/\r\n* Restify: http://restify.com/\r\n* Epilogue: https://github.com/dchester/epilogue\r\n* Sequelize: http://sequelizejs.com\r\n* Socket.io: http://socket.io/\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n* Passport: http://passportjs.org\r\n* Node ACL: https://github.com/OptimalBits/node_acl\r\n\r\nFoundations\r\n* BaconJS: https://baconjs.github.io/\r\n* SimpleBus: https://github.com/ajlopez/SimpleBus\r\n* jQuery: https://jquery.com\r\n* Immutable: https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/\r\n* Redux: http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html\r\n* Moment: http://momentjs.com/\r\n* Vantage: https://github.com/dthree/vantage\r\n* Bunyan: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan\r\n* Winston: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\r\n* Circuit breaker: https://www.npmjs.com/package/circuit-breaker or https://github.com/yammer/circuit-breaker-js\r\n* LowDb: https://github.com/typicode/lowdb\r\n\r\nRendering:\r\n* Foundation by ZURB: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html\r\n* Mustache: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js\r\n* React: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDev and build dependancies: (coming soon.)\r\n* Babel: https://babeljs.io\r\n* Chai: http://chaijs.com/\r\n* Gulp: http://gulpjs.com/\r\n* Mocha: https://mochajs.org/\r\n* JSDoc: http://usejsdoc.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the file called INSTALL.md.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTo subscribe to news or report a bug or contribute to the project, use the project website at https://github.com/lucbories/DevApt.\r\n",
